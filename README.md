**Real-Time Face Detection And Recognition System**
Hello, Everyone, this is Sajjad Hossain, a Student of Rangamati Science and Technology University pursuing my BSc in engineering in Computer Science This is one of my projects in Digital Image Processing Python development field which I have created, basically with Python-based on Studentâ€™s Attendance System that uses the property of Real-Time Face Detection And Recognition.

How to execute the program

1.	Install pycharm IDE, python 3.7
2.	Create your Firebase account for database and storage
3.	Make a JSON file for the database and copy the link from storage
4.	Change the database URL and storage bucket from the firebase generated link
5.	Execute the program

Library Requirements
1. pip install cmake
2. pip install dlib
3. pip install face-recognition
4. pip install cv zone
5. pip install Open CV-python==4.5.4.60

HERE ARE SOME PREVIEWS OF MY APPLICATION

Student Features Students will come and show their faces to the webcam. Then the Real-Time Face Detection And Recognition System program will check the image by checking the given databases that were given earlier and find the possible matching person by comparing the given image and database. While a student matches with the database, his details are shown as per the above image and show some information that was input earlier to the database.
Working Process:  Setting up Webcam > Inputting Images >  Detect Face with given images > Face Preprocessing  >  Face Encoding  >  Database Setup  > Add Data to Database (Firebase) >  Add Images to Database (Firebase) >  Real-Time Database  >  Output Visualization
Please check out my Project of Real-Time Face Detection And Recognition System to implement the code and execute the program properly.
